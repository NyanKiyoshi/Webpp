           * TODO: Future Improvements To Be Done *

---------------------------------------------------------------

* DaveLinkedList (DLL) Integration
	Allow a DLL Object to be passed and loaded into a CGI
	Wrapper variable list,
	Planned: for post-version 2 release.

* Session Support
	A stand-alone session system is vaugely under consideration.
	This will most-likely consist of a tempfile and/or cookie
	based method of persisting data without involving the client.
